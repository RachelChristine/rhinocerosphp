<p>Due to continues poaching Rhinos are one of the most critically endangered species in the world.
There are only two rhinos of the northern white rhino left, both of which are female. The last remaining male passed away in 2018. Their near extinction is due to decades of rampant poaching for Rhino horn.
The Rhinos has been hunted because some believe its horn has medicinal value.
Truth is that these animal parts, which have made the animals prime target for poachers have no proven medicinal purposes.</p>
<p>As part of the world's ecosystems, wildlife provides balance and stability to nature's processes, they deserve to live just as much as we do. They deserve respect!</p>
